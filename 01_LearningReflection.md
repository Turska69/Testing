> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- It was okay. I had some trouble with the instructions and still am unsure what is meant by uploading 'project file' to GitHub. All of them? Is there some one project file I have missed? Does this mean GitHub or GitLab? I think I managed the tasks in the end however.
     
## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
- I used the templates to help and did the actual actions simultaneously.    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
 - I don't have experience with Test case management tools

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- OSX text editor. Would've used Xcode, but it needed updating so I went ahead with textedit.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- No rather trouble than the ones described in question 1.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I didn't use GitHub for this. I used GitLab. The instructions only start mentioning GitHub when it's time to return the files. And I'm not there yet. Haven't used GitLab if this is what is meant. Have used GitHub for some school work, but not much and I find it confusing and outdated.
      
## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I will not have to automate test cases in the future. But probably selenium as it seems the most logical. But if this miracle would happen, I would have to dig more deeply and do comparison.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Programming, Frontend, SCS, Backend, Writing automated tests, databases

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Programming, SCS, test automation

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I would've liked information about the project on a bit earlier phase. Other than that everything was okay.
